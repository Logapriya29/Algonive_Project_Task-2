* It extends the basic Task Manager by introducing user authentication, session-based data storage, and UI improvements for a more personalized task management experience.
* The application allows users to create an account, log in securely, and manage their tasks independently.
* All user data is stored locally in the browser using Local Storage, ensuring that each user’s tasks remain private and persistent.
